##Pink Elephant - Web Project

Welcome to the web repository of Pink Elephant! This part of our project consist of web development.

Pink Elephant is a project dedicated to gather communities in a productive way so that they can spend more time to socialize and improve new ideas, rather than struggling with collecting and organizing it.  

Our project is an outcome of SWE 574 - Software Development as a Team course in Computer Engineering Department, Boğaziçi University.

Please have a look at [the latest release](http://162.243.215.160/#/) of our project.

Please also examine [the Project Wiki page](https://github.com/swe574-2015fall-group2/core_repo/wiki/Pink-Elephant-Wiki) including all documentation such as SPM, RSD, DSD and more.  


####Background Information Of The Project 

 
Communities of Practice / Communicating the Globe
 
Most of the communities are unable to coordinate in an effective way, or many people with common interests are unable to create a community.
 
There is also a need for academic ad-hoc groups to practice on a subject. When they want to talk about an issue or a paper, there are two types of communication are being formed:
 
- Synchronous - "Let's discuss it!"
- Asynchronous - "Let's meet! Where, when?"
 
As a result, some knowledge is generated. That needs to be recorded in a useful way. One should also find past meetings easily.
 
There would be new members, Some other may leave the community. All members also may be administered.
 
**Standard problem** - How to plan and coordinate interactions and document them in a usable form?
 
Dropbox, Doodle, E-mail - They are inefficient and they are not holistic. A meeting has to be coordinated in a particular manner.
 
**AGENDA**

- Meeting between 8 pm - 9 pm / Istanbul time
- Who will come?
- Who will manage the meeting?
- How it will be documented? Who will document it?
- Outcome of the meeting?
- Classification of meetings? (Semantic tagging)
